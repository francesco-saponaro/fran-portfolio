## Overview
The purpose of this website is to display all my project work since my coding journey began.    
I have decided to implement a backend purely for practice purpose as I wanted to utilize my new MERN stack skills. I have used the backend to store my project details and the quiz game questions.
I have also created admin functionality from which I can perform CRUD operations on both the projects and quiz section.
I have tested the API and HTTP requests with both Postman and Mocha
